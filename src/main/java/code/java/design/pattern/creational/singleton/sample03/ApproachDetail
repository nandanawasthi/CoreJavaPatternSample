Lazy initialization method to implement Singleton pattern creates the instance in the global access method. 
Here is the sample code for creating Singleton class with this approach.

The above implementation works fine incase of single threaded environment but when it comes to multithreaded systems, 
it can cause issues if multiple threads are inside the if loop at the same time. 
It will destroy the singleton pattern and both threads will get the different instances of singleton class
